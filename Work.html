                  She does her grocery shopping wherever is most convenient for her, without giving much thought to where the products come from. 
                  However, she is starting to become more aware of the impact of how she shops and is looking for ways to make a change. Sarah is the
                  perfect target for the "Farmer's Market Finder" website as she seeks to balance her busy lifestyle with her desire to live a 
                  more sustainable life.</p>
                  <br><br>
              <p> Our team conducted interviews with 12 individuals belonging to various groups - college students, adults, parents, and elders -
                  to gain insights into our target audience. The findings revealed that the typical user is a busy professional or student 
                  who values healthy living, hobbies, spends time with friends & family. Eating healthy is considered important, 
                  but only when it is both convenient and affordable for them.</p>

                <p> Meet Sarah, a busy working professional who values the convenience of shopping at the grocery store nearest to her office. She often
                relies on pre-packaged meals and ready-to-eat snacks, as they are quick and easy to prepare. However, Sarah is becoming increasingly 
                concerned about the negative impact her shopping habits have on the environment and her health. She wants to find a way to continue
                eating healthily while also reducing her carbon footprint. Sarah is struggling to find affordable and convenient sources of fresh produce,
                and is looking for a solution that will help her make more informed and sustainable shopping choices.
                <br><br>
                <p> In the designing process, I considered the challenges Sarah faced in finding affordable, healthy, and readily available food options 
                    and her desire to reduce her carbon footprint. Our team outlined several ideas to address these problems, including the encouragement
                     of shopping at the local farmer's market. Customers can purchase high-quality food that are sourced locally, thereby reducing the 
                     negative environmental impact of transportation. By supporting local farmers, users like Sarah can access fresh, whole foods that 
                     are better for their health and the environment.

                    <p> After I completed the Farmer's Market Finder website, I understood the general process of what itâ€™s like 
                        to be a Human Centered-Design & Development major. This is my first time running through a design process
                        and creating a prototype from scratch. I learned the importance of organization in the project, communicating
                        clearly with my group, and making reiterations to features that werenâ€™t effective. After the testing stage, 
                        we changed some of our original use cases and ideas to fit what works best with the users. Working on this 
                        project to create a technology that can solve global issues kept me interested in learning about the types
                        of opportunities I can pursue in this career path. </p>

                    <p>"How can we encourage individuals who buy their own groceries to shop more at locally sourced markets to 
                    minimize the impact of their shopping habits on the environment?"

                            &mdash; Improve mental health by encouraging students to practice mindfulness (i.e. take a walk, take a 
                        deep breath, etcâ€¦) through social engagement. <br><br>
                            &mdash; Increase user productivity with a personalized calendar using AI, which includes study sessions and breaks.

                <h2>Reflection</h2> 
                    <p> Working on Stars increased my awareness of the difficulty that surrounded mental health. There is no one solution that is the solution that works for everyone, but I believe there are many things that can improve a personâ€™s mentality. 

                        <br><br>
                        When finding mindful or stress relieving activities, I reflected on 
                    personal habits that made a positive impact on my productivity and 
                    mind. My team and I analyzed each otherâ€™s personal experiences and 
                    researched into activities that made a difference in our mental health, which led to the solutions we designed for STARS.
                    <br><br>
                    With this project, I understood the challenges a group can face when each person has their own vision. But the key takeaway is how efficiently a group can collaboratively achieve their common goal by listening to each personâ€™s perspective and deciding how their ideas can enhance the final solution.
